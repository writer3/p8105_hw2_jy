### Reading and cleaning the data

``` r
sub_df =
  read_csv("./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv", 
           na = c("NA", ".", "")) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude,
         route1, route2, route3, route4, route5, route6, route7,
         route8, route9, route10, route11,
         entry, entrance_type, vending, ada) |> 
  mutate(
    entry = case_match(
      entry,
      "YES" ~ 1,
      "NO" ~ 0,
    )

### Description of Dataset

The dataset “sub_df” consists of NYC transit subway lines, stations, and
the descriptions of station characteritsics, such as location, entry,
entrance type, vending, and ADA compliance. The following are the key
variables:

- `line` is a categorical variable describing the NYC transit subway
  lines.
- `station_name`is a categorical variable describing the name of the
  station.
- `station_latitude` is a continuous variable describing the latitude of
  the station in degrees.
- `station_longitude` is a continuous variable describing the longitude
  of the station in degrees.
- `route1`-`route11` are categorical variables describing the subway
  routes that stop at the station.
- `entry`is a logical variable variable describing the whether there is
  an entry to the station.
- `entry_type`is categorical variables describing the entry types of the
  station.
- `vending` is a categorical variable whether there is vending or not in
  the station.
- `ada`is a categorical describing whether there is ADA compliance in
  the station.

The dataset was cleaned, first, using the `janitor` function to convert
the variable names to lowercase and replace spaces with “\_“. Then,
variables of interests were selected. Then the entry variable was
converted from character to a logical variable using the `mutate`
function. The resulting dataset contains **1868** rows and **19**
columns. This data is tidy.

There are 465 distinct stations in this dataset.

How many stations are ADA compliant? There are 84 stations that are ADA
compliant.

468 stations are ADA compliant.

What proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow
entrance?

Reformat data so that route number and route name are distinct
variables. How many distinct stations serve the A train? Of the stations
that serve the A train, how many are ADA compliant
