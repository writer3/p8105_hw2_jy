## Problem 1

### Reading and cleaning the data

``` r
sub_df =
  read_csv("./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv", 
           na = c("NA", ".", "")) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude,
         route1, route2, route3, route4, route5, route6, route7,
         route8, route9, route10, route11,
         entry, entrance_type, vending, ada) |> 
  mutate(
    entry = case_match(
      entry,
      "YES" ~ 1,
      "NO" ~ 0,
    )
  )
```

### Description of Dataset

The dataset “sub_df” consists of NYC transit subway lines, stations, and
the descriptions of station characteritsics, such as location, entry,
entrance type, vending, and ADA compliance. The following are the key
variables:

- `line` is a categorical variable describing the NYC transit subway
  lines.
- `station_name`is a categorical variable describing the name of the
  station.
- `station_latitude` is a continuous variable describing the latitude of
  the station in degrees.
- `station_longitude` is a continuous variable describing the longitude
  of the station in degrees.
- `route1`-`route11` are categorical variables describing the subway
  routes that stop at the station.
- `entry`is a logical variable variable describing the whether there is
  an entry to the station.
- `entry_type`is categorical variables describing the entry types of the
  station.
- `vending` is a categorical variable whether there is vending or not in
  the station.
- `ada`is a categorical describing whether there is ADA compliance in
  the station.

The dataset was cleaned, first, using the `janitor` function to convert
the variable names to lowercase and replace spaces with “\_“. Then,
variables of interests were selected. Then the entry variable was
converted from character to a logical variable using the `mutate`
function. The resulting dataset contains **1868** rows and **19**
columns. This data is tidy.

There are 465 distinct stations in this dataset.

There are 84 stations that are ADA compliant.

The proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allowing
entrance is 0.3770492.

Reformatting data so that that route number and route name are distinct
variables.

``` r
sub_new_df = 
  sub_df |> 
  mutate(across(starts_with("route"), as.character)) |> 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = route1:route11,
    names_to = "routes_number",
    values_to = "route"
  )
```

There are 60 distinct stations that serve the A train.

Of the stations that serve the A train, 17 are ADA compliant.

## Problem 2

### Reading and cleaning Mr. Trash Wheel dataset

``` r
mr_df = 
  read_excel("data/202409 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 
             sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
             range = "A2:N653",
             na = c("NA", "", ".")) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  rename(
    weight = "weight_tons",
    volume = "volume_cubic_yards") |> 
  mutate(
    sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls)), 
    trash_wheel = "mr",
    year = as.numeric(year)
    ) |> 
  relocate(trash_wheel)
```

### Reading and cleaning Professor Trash Wheel dataset

``` r
prof_df = 
  read_excel("data/202409 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 
             sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel",
             range = "A2:M118",
             na = c("NA", "", ".")) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  rename(
    weight = "weight_tons",
    volume = "volume_cubic_yards") |> 
  mutate(
    trash_wheel = "professor", 
    year = as.numeric(year)
    ) |> 
  relocate(trash_wheel)
```

### Reading and cleaning Gwynnda Trash Wheel dataset

``` r
gwynnda_df = 
  read_excel("data/202409 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 
             sheet = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel",
             range = "A2:L265",
             na = c("NA", "", ".")) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  rename(
    weight = "weight_tons",
    volume = "volume_cubic_yards")|> 
  mutate(
    trash_wheel = "gwynnda",
    year = as.numeric(year)
    )|> 
  relocate(trash_wheel)
```

### Combining Trash Wheel datasets

``` r
trash_wheel_df = 
  full_join (mr_df, prof_df) |> 
  full_join (x = _, y = gwynnda_df)
```

    ## Joining with `by = join_by(trash_wheel, dumpster, month, year, date, weight,
    ## volume, plastic_bottles, polystyrene, cigarette_butts, glass_bottles,
    ## plastic_bags, wrappers, homes_powered)`
    ## Joining with `by = join_by(trash_wheel, dumpster, month, year, date, weight,
    ## volume, plastic_bottles, polystyrene, cigarette_butts, plastic_bags, wrappers,
    ## homes_powered)`
