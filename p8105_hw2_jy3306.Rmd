## Problem 1

Read and cleaning the data

Read and clean the data; retain line, station, name, station latitude / longitude, routes served, entry, vending, entrance type, and ADA compliance. Convert the entry variable from character (YES vs NO) to a logical variable (the ifelse or case_match function may be useful).

```{r}
subway_df =
  read_csv("./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv")

```
